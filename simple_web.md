viewing the source page for the website and analysing script.js shows two likeyly candidates for the username and password WebWarrior_Enigma and B4dm1Nt0n_1S_be5t_g4me.<br>
inputting both of these into the website gives the flag as "d2lyZWR7bTVfRGgwbjFfMVNfYjNzVF9jNFB0MTROfQ==" which seems to be encoded in base64<br>
decoding it gives the flag wired{m5_Dh0n1_1S_b3sT_c4Pt14N}
